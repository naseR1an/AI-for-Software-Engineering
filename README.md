# AI-for-Software-Engineering

# AI-DevOps Toolkit

This repository contains a collection of tasks focused on applying artificial intelligence in software development, testing, and analytics workflows. It covers code generation, predictive modeling, automated testing, and ethical evaluationâ€”demonstrating the power and responsibility that come with AI-enhanced development.


##  Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

### Short Answer Questions
Includes analysis on:
- The impact and limitations of AI-based code generation tools like GitHub Copilot.
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning for automated bug detection.
- Importance of bias mitigation in AI-driven personalization.

### Case Study
Explores how AIOps streamlines deployment pipelines through:
- Predictive incident response.
- Intelligent rollback systems.

Refer to `Theoretical_Analysis.pdf` for full answers.



## Part 2: Practical Implementation 

### Task 1: AI Code Completion
- Tool: GitHub Copilot
- Created and compared AI-generated vs. manually written sorting functions.
- Includes a 250-word code analysis.

### Task 2: Automated UI Testing
- Tool: Testim.io
- Test case automates login behavior for valid and invalid credentials.
- Includes test script, screenshot, and 150-word AI-enhanced testing summary.

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics
- Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data (simulated for issue priority prediction)
- Model: Random Forest with performance metrics
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, and classification report
- Jupyter notebook 


##  Part 3: Ethical Reflection 

Discusses:
- Bias concerns from underrepresented groups or teams in datasets
- Application of IBM AI Fairness 360 for audit and bias mitigation

Find full reflection in `Ethical_Reflection.pdf`.
